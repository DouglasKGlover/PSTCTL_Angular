This project aims to make tracking progress on Custom Trophy Lists on PlayStationTrophies.org simple and easy.

## What it does

Users first choose a list from the dropdown menu which they wish to track progress on. They can then check off which trophies they've earned as well as the games they own. This information is immediately (onclick) stored in HTML5 localStorage, and is shared across lists. So if you check "Game A" on "List X", "Game A" will also be checked off for you on "List Y" (all lists containing that game).

Users who have saved their progress may click on the "BBBCode" button to receive the BBCode require to sign up their progress on the site.

## What's the tech?

This is my first foray into Angular on something that is used by actual users. As such, it is not perfect and comes with no guarantees. That said, to the best of my knowledge it functions as described above. It is an ever-changing code base and is delivered "as-is"; alpha and beta phases were used to get user feedback before the launch.
